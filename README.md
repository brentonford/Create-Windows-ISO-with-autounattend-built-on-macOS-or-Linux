## Blueprints

This Project contains the following Blueprints.



### Perform Post Cleanup


### Perform Test Win Node


### Create Windows 10 (Win10) autounattend Single ISO on macOS or Linux Worker

Creates a single Windows Desktop 10 ISO with `autounattend.xml` for unattended installation.

The ISO will be created at `{ksAttuneBaseDir}/kickstart_{kickstartedNode.fqn}.iso`.

For both BIOS and UEFI kickstarts.

For BIOS kickstarts please set `isWin10Bios` to the string 'true'.

For UEFI kickstarts please set `isWin10Uefi` to the string 'true'.

Please set `isWinPEKickstart` to the string 'false'.

This blueprint assumes the drivers drop in directory is at `{automationWorkerBaseDirectory}/drivers-{newOsNode.fqn}` and has the correct drivers dropped in.

### Create Windows Server 2016 (Win2016) autounattend Single ISO on macOS or Linux Worker

Creates a single Windows Server 2016 ISO with `autounattend.xml` for unattended installation.

The ISO will be created at `{ksAttuneBaseDir}/kickstart_{kickstartedNode.fqn}.iso`.

For both BIOS and UEFI kickstarts.

For BIOS kickstarts please set `isWinServerBios` to the string 'true'.

For UEFI kickstarts please set `isWinServerUefi` to the string 'true'.

Please set `isWinPEKickstart` to the string 'false'.

This blueprint assumes the drivers drop in directory is at `{automationWorkerBaseDirectory}/drivers-{newOsNode.fqn}` and has the correct drivers dropped in.
